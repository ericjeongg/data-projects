**Data Analysis Projects Repository**

Welcome to my Data Analysis Projects Repository! This repository contains a collection of my data analysis projects, showcasing various techniques and methodologies I have used to explore, visualize, and derive insights from data.

**Introduction**

In this repository, you will find a diverse range of data analysis projects that cover different domains and utilize various tools and libraries. These projects demonstrate my skills in data manipulation, exploratory data analysis, statistical modeling, and data visualization.

Each project is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the data analysis process, including data cleaning, model development, data verification, data querying, and interpretation and visualisation of results. Additionally, the projects are documented and include explanations of the software used, data cleaning, data analysis methodology, code implementation, and key findings.
